# [NTGAN-Learning-Blind-Image-Denoising-Without-Clean-Reference](https://github.com/RickZ1010/NTGAN-Noise-Transference-Generative-Adversarial-Network-for-Blind-Unsupervised-Image-Denoising)

## Dependencies
Python >= 3.6.5, Pytorch >= 0.4.1, and cuda-9.2.

## Introduction
It is the official Demo implementation of NTGAN: Learning blind image denoising without clean reference. NTGAN is a blind unsupervised image denoiser, which can learn the denoising ability without clean-reference supervision.
