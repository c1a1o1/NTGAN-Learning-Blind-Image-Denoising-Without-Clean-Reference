A GAN-Based Unsupervised Network for blind image denoising

## Dependencies
Python >= 3.6.5, Pytorch >= 0.4.1, and cuda-9.2.

## Introduction
It is the official Demo implementation of NTGAN: Noise-Transference-Generative-Adversarial-Network-for-Blind-Unsupervised-Image-Denoising. NTGAN is a blind unsupervised deep denoiser, which can be trained without clean references.
